### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student in Japanese. I cannot speak English well but I try hard to read the sentence written in English.  

Sometimes I write shitty programs. Like this:
~~~
  unko = {
    name = "Mr.unko",
    age = 24,
    greeting = function(self)
      greeting_sentence = string.format("Hi!! I`m %s." , self.name)
      print(greeting_sentence)
    end
  }
~~~
Incidentally, "unko" is Japanese and means "poop"

btw, I use archlinux.
